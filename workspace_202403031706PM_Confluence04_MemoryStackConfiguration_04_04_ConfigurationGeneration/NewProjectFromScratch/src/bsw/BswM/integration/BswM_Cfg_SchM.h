* This is a template file.
* It defines integration functions which are necessary to be implemented.
* The integrator must complete the templates before deploying software containing functions defined in this file.
* Once templates have been completed, the integrator should delete the "removal part"
* Note: The integrator is responsible for updates made to this file.
*
* To suppress following error message, define the macro NOT_READY_FOR_TESTING_OR_DEPLOYMENT
* during compiler invocation (e.g. -DNOT_READY_FOR_TESTING_OR_DEPLOYMENT)
* The suppression of the error only allows the user to proceed with the building phase.
